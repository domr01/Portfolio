#  n8n @ domr01.org
  
Some weeks ago, my cousin Santiago told me about this tool. 
I had never heard anything about n8n, so I started to learn about It.
It was love at first sight.

But I had one problem: pricing.
I chose to host n8n locally on my VPS (yes, I pay for a VPS to practice Linux and use various tools).
Everyone knows Windows can be a memory‑space nightmare.

Now that i run n8n selfhosted with dockers, I´m having bit of fun.

#### Workflow example:

###### this is a workflow that I made, it´s called "tkd analyzer"


Now I´m looking for a project to "play" with n8n.

I think that it´s a great tool, that in the future, will become part of large-scale projects.
